## Anatomy of an R Package

Inspection of R source code for any R package will reveal the following
directories and files:

* R: for R functions
* vignettes: Latex papers weaving R code and indicating the intended workflow
  of an analysis
* man: documentation for exported R functions
* src: compiled code
* DESCRIPTION: file provides a brief description of the project, a version
  number, and any packages for which your package depends.

# Using Rcpp:

* All compiled code goes in package/src directory
* Code in src/ will be automatically compiled and shared
  libraries created when building the package.
* Instantiate an Rcpp package: Rcpp.package.skeleton
