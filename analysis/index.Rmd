### Avoiding R bottlenecks with Rcpp

I will introduce the Rcpp package for streamlining R code with C++ functions
to avoid some common computational bottlenecks when writing R functions in a
manner that's easy to use with minimal C++ knowledge. During the presentation,
I will provide an example of developing a package with compiled code and
demonstrate the "workflowr" package for organizing your projects into a
version controlled website for documenting your results.

This document is broken into three main sections: 

1. [Brief introduction to Rcpp](intro.html)
1. [Building a package](packages.html)
1. [Case study: Skew Normal Mixture distributions](sn_mix.html)

## Using workflowr
This document was created using <tt>workflowr</tt>.
